Welcome!

I'll write about programming and IT. Some posts will be more like tutorials and others my personal opinion.
I'm studying IT and working in the area as well. I feel most comfortable with Python and Django, but I have experience with JavaScript, Java and PHP as well.

My first code-snippet.
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Visitor')
#=> prints 'Hi, Visitor' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
